# A Shell in Perl

This is a silly quick go at the tutorial 
https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/

But using perl because:
    
    - Not quite comfortable with memory managment concepts in C yet,
    
    - Perl has the fork() &c similiar to C, so learning some things

In the end:
    
    - perl packages make it almost trivial,
    
    - got caught up in perl function references...
